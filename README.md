# Genesis-Py
Genesis implementation using Python

Genesis-Py requires at least Python v3.6.5 installed on your computer.

To check if you have the latest version of Python installed, you can open your operating system's command line and enter:
    python -V

Genesis-Py depends on the pyplot and wxpython libraries.

Make sure you have the latest version of pip3

enter into your command line:
    pip3 pip install -U wxPython

if you are using a Linux system, you must instead enter:
    pip install -U \-f https://extras.wxpython.org/wxPython4/extras/linux/gtk3/ubuntu-16.04 \
    wxPython

To install pyplot, enter the following commands into your command line:
    python -mpip install -U pip
    python -mpip install -U matplotlib

No special installation is required for Genesis-Py and the file can simply be executed from the root folder of the program.
This has been tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS operating systems.

For Windows 10 and Linux Ubuntu 16.04LTS users, double click on the latest version of Genesis-Py in the root folder of the program.

If this does not work, open terminal in Linux or cmd in Windows, make sure you are located in the program's root directory and run the following:
    python Genesis-Py_v0.0.8a
